// fieldMatcher represents a state in the matching automaton, which matches field names and dispatches to
//  valueMatcher to complete matching of name/value combinations.  fieldMatcher has a map which is keyed by the
//  field pathSegments values that can start transitions from this matcher; for each such field, there is a
//  valueMatcher which, given the field's value, determines whether the automaton progresses to another fieldMatcher
// matches contains the X values that arrival at this state implies have matched
// existsFalseFailures reports the condition that traversal has occurred by matching a field which is named in an
//  exists:false pattern, and the named X's should be subtracted from the matches list being built up by a match project
